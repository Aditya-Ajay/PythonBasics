Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function 
when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

IT BASICALLY TELLS WITH THE INCREASING INPUT , HOW MUCH TIME AND SPACE IS REQUIRED

    because on the scal where the input size is in  millions the importance of constant decrease 
    as constant in any step does not scale with the input to the function
